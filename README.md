# Addition-Game---Castle-Connon-Siege

Castle Cannon Siege is an interactive 2D math game developed for IQ Learning Platform.

The game is created with Unity, a game engine for building interactive 2D and 3D experiences. It uses C# to implement game logic, physics-based cannonball motion, and user interaction.

Players solve simple addition problems and aim the cannon at the character with the correct answer. The predicted trajectory is shown with white dots based on Unity’s physics system, including gravity and velocity.

## Mockups
This game was originally inspired by Angry Birds. Based on that foundation and added a medieval adventure theme, with a cannon, a castle, and brave little soldiers guarding the answers. (https://www.figma.com/design/uVu3QluHP2ZZrdoSrmk4KB/addition?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=3VUYrcvwY26Ql5P5-0)
